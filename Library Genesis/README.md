## Motivation
Library genesis is well known web portal to download books for free. Though its openly available, webpages have some advertisements, and other risky links that could lead a visitor to harmful URLs. This application simply takes the input from the user and search the library genesis portal and gives back the links of all book download sources. May not be legal but for all those who are using this application, I would say, this is a practise project for me. I cannot assure you that this is safe. So use at your own risk.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any legal actions that you face because of using this application. I personally am not encouraging anyone to find shortcuts to get free books.

# Thank You
